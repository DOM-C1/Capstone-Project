This project is a game based off of Wordle with my own twist, Arcade Mode; this mode features a timer and a difficulty adjuster that uses a player's data to dynaminally ajust after each round.
A function will decide the difficulty of the word, length of the word and the amount of time that should be allocated to find the word. The game uses a free API to check words are legit, also, the API pulls 
words by theme, with a tag on how frequent this word which is used to decide the difficulty.
